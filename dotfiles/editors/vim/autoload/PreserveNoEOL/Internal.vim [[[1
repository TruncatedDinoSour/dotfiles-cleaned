" Preserve noeol (missing trailing eol) when saving file. In order
" to do this we need to temporarily 'set binary' for the duration of
" file writing, and for DOS line endings, add the CRs manually.
" For Mac line endings, also must join everything to one line since it doesn't
" use a LF character anywhere and 'binary' writes everything as if it were Unix.

" This works because 'eol' is set properly no matter what file format is used,
" even if it is only used when 'binary' is set.
