All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

\"airplane\", \"hardcover\" and \"bookstore\"):\nhttps://proofingtoolgui.org/faq.html#7\nDue to complaints, \"movie\" was added on V2.57 since it is a widely used word.\n\nChangelog:\nhttps://proofingtoolgui.org/en_GB_CHANGES.txt\n\nThis GB speller is Mozilla's official one :\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools\n\nAbout ize/ise:\nJust like in other languages, some words can be written differently. Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts and not for regular users.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nState and union territory capitals in India\nOn V2.90 I added them to the dictionary, since they are in valid English (Wikipedia).\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (like \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (like \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nWords regarding COVID-19\nOn V2.83 I added tons of entries regarding the pandemic.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find American words, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\nArchaic words:\nI will only add archaic words if they don't interfere with other words.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015, I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access to Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon, having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries above. This is slower and harder, but the results are much better and accurate.\n\nOn 25.Aug.2013 I released a \"forked\" V2.00. The speller has been made available to OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. So far, I have added 126 047+ words (as of V3.0.3).","weeklyDownloads":1097,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"Marco A.G.Pinto","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/10237465/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/261/261746.png?modified=1632732148","width":943,"height":566,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/261/261746.jpg?modified=1632732148","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":320,"caption":"Installing the dictionary on Firefox (2021-09-27)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/261/261747.png?modified=1632732148","width":501,"height":550,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/261/261747.jpg?modified=1632732148","thumbnailWidth":364,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Activating the dictionary on Firefox 1/2 (2021-09-27)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/261/261748.png?modified=1632732149","width":943,"height":566,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/261/261748.jpg?modified=1632732149","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":320,"caption":"Activating the dictionary on Firefox 2/2 (2021-09-27)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/260/260332.png?modified=1632732144","width":1282,"height":627,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/260/260332.jpg?modified=1632732144","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":261,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 191)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/260/260333.png?modified=1632732144","width":1282,"height":627,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/260/260333.jpg?modified=1632732144","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":261,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 191)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/260/260334.png?modified=1632732144","width":1282,"height":627,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/260/260334.jpg?modified=1632732144","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":261,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 191)"}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/marcoagpinto/4eur?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5169,"reviewCount":25,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/british-english-dictionary-2/reviews/","updateDate":1638250561000},{"id":"{529b261b-df0b-4e3b-bf42-07b462da0ee8}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-32.png?modified=82fd0582","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-64.png?modified=82fd0582","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-128.png?modified=82fd0582"},"name":"Universal Bypass","version":"13.15.2.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3815811/universal_bypass-13.15.2.1-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://universal-bypass.org/","supportURL":"https://universal-bypass.org/","description":"Don't waste your time with compliance.

This add-on simply adds a small noise to the actual fingerprint and renews it every time you visit a website or reload a page.\n\nWith the browser's WebGL API, in general, two types of fingerprints can be generated.

This add-on disables the API for all pages.\n\nPausing playback of a video or other processing in a background tab is useful to save energy. So only enable this add-on if you can afford it.\n\nThere are other ways to detect if a webpage is visible, e.g. onblur/onfocus. This add-on does not disable any of those other ways. So do not assume that this add-on will enhance your privacy.","weeklyDownloads":22,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Frank Dreßler","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/13614107/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7059,"reviewCount":8,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/disable-page-visibility/reviews/","updateDate":1513711811000},{"id":"{c42bbee5-f23b-4580-a2c2-2c50b5e950f1}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.png?v=20210601","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.png?v=20210601","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.png?v=20210601"},"name":"Gruvbox Dark Soft","version":"1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3785283/gruvbox_dark-1.0-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://galaxiateam.tk","description":"A simple dark Gruvbox theme, with soft contrast.","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":3,"type":"theme","creator":{"name":"Satyrn","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/15458816/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/3848/3848851.png?modified=1623036542","width":680,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/3848/3848851.png?modified=1623036542","thumbnailWidth":473,"thumbnailHeight":64},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/3848/3848854.svg?modified=1623036542","width":720,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/3848/3848854.jpg?modified=1623036542","thumbnailWidth":720,"thumbnailHeight":92}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":0,"reviewCount":0,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gruvbox-dark-soft/reviews/","updateDate":1622563824000}]}
