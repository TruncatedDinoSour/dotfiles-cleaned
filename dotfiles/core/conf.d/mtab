# As far as we are aware, there are no modern linux tools or use cases
# which require /etc/mtab to be a separate file from /proc/self/mounts,
# so this setting should be commented out.
# If it is set to yes, please comment it out and run this command:
# # rc-service mtab restart
# In the future, the mtab service will be removed since we are not aware
# of any need to manipulate /etc/mtab as a separate file from
# /proc/self/mounts.
# If you have a technical reason we should keep this support, please
# open an issue at https://github.com/openrc/openrc/issues and let us
# know about your situation.
# This setting controls whether /etc/mtab is a file or symbolic link.
# mtab_is_file=no
